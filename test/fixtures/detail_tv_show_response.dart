            "I don’t think this is the best episode of the Simpsons, it’s not even in the period most consider the best seasons (4-8), but it’s my favorite episode. It perfectly encapsulates what made the Simpsons amazing in the 90s: right amount of heart, wacky but not balls to the wall, and integrating a celebrity without it seeming like the episode was one long promo for that celebrity – fully understand the irony of that because he’s playing Michael Jackson in the episode.
